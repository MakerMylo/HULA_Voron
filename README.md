# HULA for Voron 
![HULA for Voron](https://github.com/thrutheframe/HULA_Voron/assets/68491566/2d44f706-aa4d-4024-b6c8-bb02da131682)

### What is HULA?
HULA is an Omnidirectional Self-Aligning Anti-Vibration Foot specifically designed to dampen movement vibration generated by fast 3D printers. It decouples the printer from the table and dampens the horizontal XY forces of corexy & cartesian printers, preventing the printer from swaying/wobbling. This reduces the stress on the printer frame, improves print quality (depending on variables) and reduces the shake translated to the table and other printers. HULA was initially designed for my Bambu Lab X1C & P1P, but is now adapted to many different brands and types of 3D printers. 

HULA for Voron is designed with the same principles in mind.  The HULA centre core (designed for the Creality K1) is fitted with specific feet adaptors for the various Voron printers.

# INSTRUCTIONS
Please download HULA for Voron Supplementary Guide for installation. I do my best to double-check and test the print profile I create. They are up to date with whatever changes I made to the designs. 

# STEP and STL files
1) I have included the step file to the base adapter plates for those needing mods to fit existing mods. This is because the design was derived from Voron CAD which comes under the GPL3.0 license
2) I will only share the STL of HULA because it is my design and I prefer to keep it under the Standard Digital File License. 
4) HULA itself is free to download for personal use, No sharing or redistribution of original design or remixes. 
5) I recommend Orca Slicer for this project. The settings are prepared in the 3mf file. Please refer to the settings in Orca if you want to use your own preferred slicer (ie Cura) 


#CONCLUSION & CAVEAT
As with all my designs, Prototyping and testing were conducted to ensure printability and meet my expectations. However, I understand it may and may not work for you. I request that you read all instructions before printing and installing them at your discretion.
