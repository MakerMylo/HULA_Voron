### What is HULA?
HULA is an Omnidirectional Self-Aligning Anti-Vibration Foot specifically designed to dampen movement vibration generated by fast 3D printers. It decouples the printer from the table and dampens the horizontal XY forces of corexy & cartesian printers, preventing the printer from swaying/wobbling. This reduces the stress on the printer frame, improves print quality (depending on variables) and reduces the shake translated to the table and other printers. HULA was initially designed for my Bambu Lab X1C & P1P, but is now adapted to many different brands and types of 3D printers. 

HULA for Voron is designed with the same principles in mind.  The HULA centre core (designed for the Creality K1) is fitted with specific feet adaptors for the various Voron printers.
