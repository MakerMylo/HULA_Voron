### What is HULA?
HULA is an Omnidirectional Self-Aligning Anti-Vibration Foot specifically designed to dampen movement vibration generated by fast 3D printers. It decouples the printer from the table and dampens the horizontal XY forces of corexy & cartesian printers, preventing the printer from swaying/wobbling. This reduces the stress on the printer frame, improves print quality and reduces the shake translated to the table and other printers.
